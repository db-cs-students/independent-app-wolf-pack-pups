## Welcome to Lifekeeper
Do you have lots of things to do for a day and they're on different topics? Well the Lifekeeper App is just for you. 
This app will make your life easier and organized. 

## About Lifekeeper
You can add current and future tasks to the app. Not only that, but you can set the category to that pacific task; making things more organized.

## How to use Lifekeeper
* On the HomeScreen of the app, tap on the box that says "To-Do" and then you will see a screen with the tasks that you will add.

* If you already added a task, you can tap on that task and that task's details will pop up for you to look at.

* On that same screen (not the pop up) there's a plus button and it will navigate you to a screen where you add your tasks.

* At the top of that screen there's a screen picker and if you tap "Edit Categories", you'll navigate to a screen where the app stores your categories of your tasks. However, if you haven't added any categories yet, then there will be nothing on the screen.

* Tap "Add Category" and it will navigate you to another screen where you type the category and add it to the Edit Categories screen.
